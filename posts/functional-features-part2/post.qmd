# Part 1

This is a continuation of ongoing research.
Read [part 1]() for more details on the nature of the research.

# About

This work hasn't been initiated yet.
My idea is to replicate a Catch22 analysis.
The devs/ researchers behind Catch22 tested their 22 features using a series of data sets.
I will find one of these data sets, I believe they're avaiable, and attempt to replciate their results.
Then, I will calculate my functional features.
Finally, I'll evaluate results.

My hope is that the functional features are at least as good as the Catch22 features.
It's also possible that the functional features are more pertinent to some domains than others.
