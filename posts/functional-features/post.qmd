# About

This work is exploratory and currently unfinished.
The purpose of the work is to assess if features created using functional data analysis are useful.
The work was inspired by [Catch22](https://github.com/hendersontrent/catch22).

As far as I am aware, this is novel research.

The following is a description from the Catch22 GitHub repo:

> Catch22 is a collection of 22 time-series features coded in C that can be run from Python, R, Matlab, and Julia. The catch22 features are a high-performing subset of the over 7000 features in hctsa

# Details

I've been working and learning about functional data analysis on and off for the past three years.
Over the course of this time I learned about Catch22 and other works([hctsa](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa), [theft](https://github.com/hendersontrent/theft), [feast](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/feasts/index.html)).

Much of my work focused on analyzing energy consumption data.
During this time I learned that the deriatives of energy consumption were helpful to gain a more complete understanding of consumption patterns.
The derivatives are velocity and accelartion.

With functional data analysis it's trivial to estimate the velocity and accerlation of a smooth curve fitted to the data.
I thought that summarizing these derivatives into features would be helpful/ predictive.

# Analysis

The first step is to evaluate if the functional features are *significant*.
I will attempt to assess this by comparing the functional features agains features from existing libraries.
This is a [link]() to the code.

If the funcitonal features are found to be predictive, then a subsequent step would be to produce a package so others can test the features for themselves.

**Progress:**

- step 1: evaluation of functional features: work in progress
- step 2: create a package
